Why e.target.innerText not e.target.value?
Ans: Since you are dealing with button elements (<button>), they don't have a value property by default, but they do contain text within them (like "1", "2", "+", etc.). This text is what is rendered on the button and what you want to append to the current calculator input. innerText retrieves that text.

If you used e.target.value, it would return undefined for a button, because buttons donâ€™t have a value attribute unless explicitly set. e.target.innerText correctly retrieves the text content of the button, which you are trying to use in your calculator input.
